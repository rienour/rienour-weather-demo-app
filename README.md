# Rienour Weather API - Demo Application

The purpose of this application is to showcase developer ability to write data to a database, where the information to write into the database is sourced from an external API. This project will include a basic frontend for proof of functionality and an API to handle data fetching.

## Demo Application Goals

1. Create a basic page that allows investigating the weather for a city in a 10 day range.
  - The City name should be visible on the screen
  - A button should be present to move the visible day forward 1 day
  - A button should be present to move the visible day backward 1 day
  - A button should be visible to handle toggling between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature
  - An alert should be displayed when attempting to navigate back or forward outside the temperature range
1. The 10 day range should include 4 days prior to the date of the request, the day of the request, and 5 days into the future for the request.
1. The user should be prompted for what city they want to check.
